# Merkle Trees
~Utilizes Merkle Trees as a cost-effective way of storing data for a Whitelist.


## Tech Stack
~Project uses Chai assertion library along with Mocha for conducting unit tests.

~In this project I used Hardhat for an Ethereum development environment and framework. I go on to use React a javascript framework used to make websites and Next.js 
is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend, so you don't need two separate frontend and backend services.

### Overview/Notes
High gas fees nullify many of the benefits that come with blockchain to a large part of the population.  Merkle Trees allow for computation of a simpler & more efficent 
Merkle Root alone to reduce fees.
